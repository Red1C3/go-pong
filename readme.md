# Go-Pong
A Pong video game clone made with Go lang and OpenGL 3.3 using C.
## Gameplay
Key bindings are 'w' and 's' for the left player and 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' for the right player, score is kept in terminal (for now...)
## Dependencies
- [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm)
- [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [glfw](https://glfw.org/)
## Building
After installing the required dependencies, run ```go build```, make sure your executable is in the same folder than contains the *Shader* folder.
## Roadmap
For now the game only supports offline 2 players mode, but it's planned to have an online multiplayer (I won't provide any game servers).

Also a real score board might be added in the future.
